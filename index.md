#### An end-to-end encrypted, peer-to-peer file storage, sharing and communication network. 


Peergos is designed to give you back control over your data. It is an open source, secure, self hostable file storage and sharing platform. All your files are encrypted locally and your private keys never leave your machine. 


Peergos aims to be resistant to surveillance of data content or friendship graphs. It will have a secure email replacement, Key-mail, with some interoperability with email. There will also be a totally private and secure social network, where users are in control of who sees what (executed cryptographically). 


The name Peergos comes from the Greek word Πύργος (Pyrgos), which means stronghold or tower, but phonetically spelt with the nice connection to being peer-to-peer.
