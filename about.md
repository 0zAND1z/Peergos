We started Peergos in August 2013 with the aim of a secure decentralised file storage and sharing network with a secure email replacement. 

The Team
--------
#Ian
Ian did his DPhil in Particle Physics at Oxford University, during which he mainly worked on a new x86 system emulator, [JPC](https://github.com/ianopolous/JPC). After his doctorate he was the lead developer on an x86 Linux process emulator which was able to achieve 80% native speed on x86 hardare. As well as emulation, he is passionate about distributed systems and cryptography, which is in his blood as his grandfather worked at Bletchley park during WWII. Both of these are in abundance in Peergos.  

#Chris
Chris also has a DPhil in Particle Physics from Oxford University and used to work on the Large Hadron Collider before turning his focus to software engineering. He has written an ACID compliant distributed noSQL database with better performance than Cassandra. 

#Kevin
Kevin has a lot of experience in high performance software and web applications. He ported two x86 emulators to Javascript, including the world's first full x86 system emulator that ran in Javascript.
