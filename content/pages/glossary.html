        <p>Here you will find some key terms used on the Peergos website.</p>

    <section>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>Peergos Channel</h3>
          <p>Read all about the Peergos channels <a href="peergos.org/channels">here.</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>Peergos Protocol</h3>
          <p>Peergos is defined by a number of protocols: <a href="https://github.com/xsf/xeps/blob/master/inbox/peergos-channels.xml">
            channel-server protocol</a>, and the media server protocol 
          (in progress). Peergos works with teams at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/">W3C</a>, 
          <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Standards">Mozilla Foundation</a>, and <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP Standards 
          Foundation</a> to champion the open, silo-free internet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>Cloud Install</h3>
          <p>The <a href="https://hosting.peergos.org/login">hosted version</a> of Peergos.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>Communication Silo</h3>
          <p>A communication silo refers to a service, like Skype for example, where users are unable to freely communicate 
          with users on other services. Communication within  a silo is always vertical, making it difficult or impossible 
          for the system to work with unrelated systems. The opposite of a silo is a service like email where users on one 
          email provider can email users on another email provider running different email software and the services 
          interoperate to receive the message.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>Content Plugins</h3>
          <p>The Peergos server supports validation of custom content types by means of a plugin system. By default the
          Peergos server supports Atom content. Additional content types can be supported by creating an appropriate 
          validator and packaging it as a plugin.</p>
          <div class="contact">
            <a href="https://github.com/peergos/peergos-server-java/blob/master/manual/plugins.md" class="github">Code</a>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>DNS Service Discovery</h3>
          <p><a href="http://peergos.org/install#peergos_dns_">Peergos uses DNS</a> to discover the API endpoint for
          any domain. DNS-SD returns a TXT record with the correct API to use. For example: query for the
          <code>_peergos-api._tcp.example.com TXT</code> record returns.   
          <code>"v=1.0 host=peergos.EXAMPLE.COM protocol=https path=/api port=443"</code></p> 
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>Extensible</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="/theme/img/diagrams/Extensible.png" alt="extensible-diagram" class="pull-left hidden-xs" style="padding-right:20px; padding-top:20px;" />
          </figure>
          <p>Your personalised Peergos stack can run with just the components you need. Each Buddycloud component
          is designed to be extensible and easily re-deployable and avoids locking you into a one-size-fits-all messaging 
          stack.</p>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>Federated (Distributed, Decentralised)</h3>
          <p>Examples of federated systems include the worldwide email network and DNS service. Each site can run its 
          own email server and email from <code>aunt@gmail.com</code> reaches <code>you@example.com</code>. Just like email,
          all services on Peergos federate meaning that your users can connect, share and message with users on other 
          Peergos-enabled sites. Without gatekeepers. Without limitations.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/theme/img/diagrams/federation.png" alt="federation-diagram" class="pull-right hidden-xs" style="padding-left:20px;" />
          </figure>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>IoT (Internet of Things)</h3>
          <p>The network of physical objects embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to create 
          devices that exchange data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>On Premises</h3>
          <p><a href="http://peergos.org/install">Peergos installed</a> on your hardware, on your network and 
          maintained by you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>Open Source</h3>
         <figure>
            <img src="/theme/img/diagrams/open-source.png" alt="open-source-diagram" class="pull-right hidden-xs" style="padding-left:20px;" />
          </figure>
          <p>All Peergos code is released as open source on GitHub.</p>
          <div class="contact">
            <a href="https://github.com/peergos" class="github">Code</a>
          </div>
        <h3>Open Standards</h3>
          <p>Building on open standards means you tap into a rich set of existing libraries. Using open protocols also 
          mean your code will interoperate with other services.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>Push Notifications (Server Push)</h3>
          <p>Push notifications let you remotely wake up your application with a "there's new content" or 
          "something happened" message. Sometimes this is just a "someone followed you" message. 
          Other times it's a "you should pull down fresh content" command and your application can then 
          synchronise the content.</p>
          <div class="contact">
            <a href="https://github.com/peergos/peergos-pusher" class="github">Code</a>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>TLS Encryption</h3>
          <p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications 
          security over a computer network. By default Peergos is setup to ensure all communication between 
          clients and servers is encrypted.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>XMPP</h3>
          <p>The <a href="http://xmpp.org">Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</a>
          is an open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant 
          messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content 
          syndication, and generalized routing of XML data.</p>
