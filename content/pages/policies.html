      including any intellectual property rights related to such services, whether or not they are officially registered

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Rights &amp; Obligations of Peergos</h3>
      <p>Peergos will provide its users with the Buddycloud's product and services as well as give active support service
      when necessary, doing the best to provide reasonable available service. Peergos reserves the right to suspend or 
      deactivate a user's account (on the hosted service or Peergos sites that we run: peergos.org/org/net) and to 
      prohibit his access to the Peergos's services, for malicious use of the Buddycloud's stack, the use of Buddycloud's

      respect all applicable laws to the performance of his services, including those related to his product as well as 
      those related to the services provided to his own users.</p>
      <p>[As ridiculous as it sounds, our lawyers tell us that we need to include the following paragraph]</p>
      <p>Customers must notify Peergos when they become involved in any illegal, fraudulent or violation of rights that 
      can affect Peergos or their own personal interest. They shall notify the Buddycloud's team when they are aware or

      <p>The customer enables Peergos to use an external party to process payments, and will facilitate their bank and
      personal details to such an entity in order to make the corresponding payments to Peergos, for credit verification
      and administration of your account. The payment terms will be specified in advance, unless expressed differently 
      through a written form.</p>
      <p>Peergos will send the bills to the contact email address provided by the user when registering into the service.
      Bills shall be paid by the user within 30 calendar days after the invoice due date. If the payment hasn't been done
      by then, Peergos will proceed with the suspension of the services unless agreed otherwise by both parties.</p>
